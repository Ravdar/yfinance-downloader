This is a simple GUI application that allows users to download OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance Python library. The application provides a quick and intuitive way to download the data and save it in a selected destination folder. It detects whether a date already exists in a given location and, if so, combines it, so you can collect data from a long periods of time.
